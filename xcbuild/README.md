**xcbuild** is an Xcode-compatible build tool with the goal of providing faster builds, better documentation of the build process and running on multiple platforms (macOS, Linux, and Windows)

### xcbuild and other build tools

[xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool) | [Buck](https://github.com/facebook/buck) | [xcpretty](https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty)
----|----|---
xcbuild and [xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool) are both Xcode-compatible build systems. We plan on slowly deprecating xctool's build support but keep it as a great way to run tests. | Facebook's main build system is [Buck](https://buckbuild.com). Buck has a stronger architecture and advanced features like artifact caching while having a much simpler build format. If you have a new project, it's highly recommended. | xcbuild works great with [xcpretty](https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty). Pipe the output from xcbuild to xcpretty the same way as you would from `xcodebuild`.

## Building

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/xcbuild.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/xcbuild)

- Xcode 7 or later, on macOS.
- GCC 4.8 or later, on Linux. `libpng16-dev`, `zlib1g-dev`, `libxml2-dev`, and `pkg-config` are also required.
- Visual Studio 2015 or later, on Windows. A `zlib` DLL is also required.
- [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) and [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) (or [llbuild](https://github.com/apple/swift-llbuild)).
  - With [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/): `brew install cmake ninja`
  - With [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org): `choco install cmake ninja`

To build:

 - All platforms:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/facebook/xcbuild
cd xcbuild
git submodule update --init
```

 - Linux and macOS:

```sh
make
```

Build output will be in the `build` directory. Run xcbuild with `./build/xcbuild`.

 - Windows (experimental):

```sh
cmake -Bbuild -H. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" -DZLIB_ROOT=<path>
```

Open `build\xcbuild.sln` and build.


## Usage

The command line options are compatible with [xcodebuild](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/xcodebuild.1.html).

```
xcbuild -workspace Example.xcworkspace -scheme Example
```

### Using Ninja (or llbuild)

To switch to the significantly faster [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) executor:

```sh
xcbuild -executor ninja [-workspace Example.xcworkspace ...]
```

Besides the `-executor ninja` parameters, the options are otherwise identical. The Ninja executor is fastest if it can avoid re-generating the Ninja files if the build configuration and input project files do not change.
